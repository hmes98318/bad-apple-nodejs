# bad-apple-nodejs
This is a Node.js script that plays the Bad Apple!!  

The script uses [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert the video to a series of image frames, and then converts each frame to an ASCII image using a custom algorithm. The resulting ASCII art frames are then played back in the console.  


## Installation
Clone the repository or download the code files.  
Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.  


## Usage
Run the script by executing `npm run start` in the project directory.  
The script will start extracting the frames from the video and converting them to ASCII art.  
Once completed, the ASCII art will be displayed in the console and played.  

Note: This script requires extracting every frame of the video for conversion, which may take some time depending on your computer's performance and the length of the video
